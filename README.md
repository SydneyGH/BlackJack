This code comes with two items, one folder and one python file. The folder holds a list of card pictures that are “.png”. The modules that are used in this project are “Tkinter” and “Random”. 
The Tkinter module is used to create the GUI, which helps you play the game. 
The Random module is used to select random cards for each player.
